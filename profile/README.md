# The Missing Trust Layer

The Internet is broken. All existing communication channels are insecure, and obsolete. Because all existing communication channels rely on public identifiers, anyone that knows your identifier can reach you.

Furthermore, existing communication channel do not provide a sure-fire way of verifying service providers and end-user Identity. This is an open door to spam, phishing, fraud, identity theft...

Regarding service providers and services, each service has it own registration process, fastidious password rules... and/or they are usually using federated login, that makes you depend on a third party service for accessing your accounts.

If the World Wide Web was initially designed for interoperability, major companies have managed to transform it to a closed, centralized internet, that we all depend on.

Not to talk about privacy, and what's done with our data.

To build a new, trustable internet, we need new, trustable communication channels, where both ends can be clearly identified, and where providing a service, accessing a service, or creating a new account, should be as simple as presenting a credential.

A trust layer, open to any participant, is required for that.

The mission of The Verana Foundation is to specify and provide the bricks for building The Missing Trust Layer.

Stay tuned.
